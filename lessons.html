        	this lesson, the techniques of "hammer-ons" and "pull-offs" are covered. These techniques differ from standard right-hand

	<td>This lesson is for the more daring players that have a handle on chords, scales, rhythm, and proper technique but still want more.
       	 The technique of "sweep picking" has become popular in guitar soloing due to the greater speed at which you can play arpeggios,
        	which can make your solos sound blazing fast. This is one of the more difficult techniques to learn because the chances are if you're 
       	 not doing something properly, it just won't work.  This one takes a lot of patience and even more practice.</td>

<h3>Scale Exercises</h3>
<p>This section contains tablatures for three basic minor scales to practice: A minor, E minor, and D minor. These scales range from different positions on the neck and can be used
   together to improvise your own guitar solo. Each scale starts on its root note, then ascends and descends. Practice playing these scales with different rhythms and speeds so you
   can learn to create your own melody.</p>
